Issue: The sparse-view data reconstruction is one of typical underdetermined inverse problems, how to reconstruct high-quality CT images from dozens of projections is still a challenge in practice. 

Goal: To address this challenge, in this article we proposed a Multi-domain Integrative Swin Transformer network (MIST-net).

Features: 

(1) The MIST-net incorporated lavish domain features from data, residual-data, image, and residual-image using flexible network architectures. Here, the residual-data and residual-image domains network components can be considered as the data consistency module to eliminate interpolation errors in both residual data and image domains, and then further retain image details. 

(2): To detect the image features and further protect image edge, the trainable Sobel Filter was incorporated into the network to improve the encode-decode ability. 

(3). With the classical Swin Transformer, we further designed the high-quality reconstruction transformer (i.e., Recformer) to improve the reconstruction performance. The Recformer inherited the power of Swin transformer to capture the global and local features of the reconstructed image.Â
